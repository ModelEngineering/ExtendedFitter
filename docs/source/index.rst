Welcome to ExtendedFitter's documentation!
==========================================

ExtendedFitter extends the capabilities of ``lmfit`` in several ways:

1. ensures that the parameters reported have the smallest residual sum of squares;

2. provides for running several optimizers in sequence;

3. reports statistics on the runtime and quality improvmenets (reductions in residual sum of squares).
