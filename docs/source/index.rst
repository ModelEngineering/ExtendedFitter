fitterpp: Simplified Parameter Fitting With Advanced Capabilities
=================================================================

fitterpp (pronounced "fitter plus plus") fits parameters of a function in a more
convenient and sophisticated way than what is provided by ``lmfit``.

1. simplifies parameter fitting to do in that users only provide the parameterized function;

2. ensures that the parameters reported have the smallest residual sum of squares;

3. provides for running several fitting algorithm in succession;

4. reports statistics on the runtime and quality of parameter fits.
