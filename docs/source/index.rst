Welcome to fitterpp's documentation!
==========================================

fitterpp (pronounced "fitter plus plus") extends the capabilities of ``lmfit`` in several ways:

1. simplifies the parameter fitting process;

2. ensures that the parameters reported have the smallest residual sum of squares;

3. provides for running several optimizers in sequence;

4. reports statistics on the runtime and quality improvmenets (reductions in residual sum of squares).
