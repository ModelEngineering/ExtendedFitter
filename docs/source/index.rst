fitterpp: Simplified Parameter Fitting With Advanced Capabilities
=================================================================

fitterpp (pronounced "fitter plus plus") extends the capabilities of ``lmfit`` in several ways:

1. simplifies parameter fitting by automating the calculation of residuals;

2. ensures that the parameters reported have the smallest residual sum of squares;

3. provides for running several fitting algorithm in succession;

4. reports statistics on the runtime and quality of parameter fits.
